## Comments:

* On the checks for actel 1.3.0, a note is issued regarding 
  svglite being an unused dependency. While actel does not require svglite 
  directly, it is a necessary "suggested" package of ggplot2, and I want 
  to ensure that it is installed.

* On resubmission: Fixed url that had been moved permanently
  as per the incoming checks.
