\title{Convert Lotek CDMA log to csv}
\usage{
convertLotekCDMAFile(file, date_format = "\%m/\%d/\%y")
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{the file name.}

\item{date_format}{the format used by the computer that generated the file}
}
\value{
A data frame of standardized detections from the input file.
}
\description{
Lotek CDMA logs are exported in TXT, and contain several chunks of
of information. Importantly, the detections may be saved with a GMT offset,
as opposed to the more common UTC standard.
Additionally, the date format isn't the standard yyyy-mm-dd.
}
\details{
This function extracts the detections from the CDMA file, converts the
dates to yyyy-mm-dd, binds the time to the date and resets it to UTC, and
ultimately converts the dataframe into the standard format accepted by actel.
}
\examples{
# create a dummy detections file to read
dummy_file <- tempfile()
sink(dummy_file)
