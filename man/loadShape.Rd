\usage{
loadShape(
  shape,
  size,
  spatial = "spatial.csv",
  coord.x = NULL,
  coord.y = NULL,
  buffer = NULL,
  type = c("land", "water")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shape}{The path to a shapefile containing land polygons of the study
area.}

\item{size}{The pixel size, in the same unit as the coordinate system.
I.e., usually either metres or degrees.}

\item{spatial}{Either a character string specifying the path to a spatial.csv
file or a spatial data frame. This argument is not mandatory, but can be
used to perform an early check of the shape file's compatibility with the
study stations and release sites.}

\item{coord.x, coord.y}{The names of the columns containing the x and y
positions of the stations in the spatial.csv file. these coordinates
MUST BE in the same coordinate system as the shape file.}

\item{buffer}{Artificially expand the map edges. Can be a single value
(applied to all edges) or four values (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax). The unit
of the buffer depends on the shape file's coordinate system.}

\item{type}{The type of shapefile being loaded. One of "land", if the
shapefile's polygons represent landmasses, or "water", if the shapefile's
polygons represent water bodies.}

A raster object.
