\usage{
loadStudyData(
  tz,
  override = NULL,
  start.time,
  stop.time,
  save.detections = FALSE,
  section.order = NULL,
  exclude.tags,
  disregard.parallels = TRUE,
  discard.orphans = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tz}{The time zone of the study area. Must match one of the values
present in \code{\link[base]{timezones}}.}

\item{override}{A vector of signals for which the user intends to manually
define which movement events are valid and invalid.}

\item{start.time}{Detection data prior to the timestamp set in
\code{start.time} (in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format) is not considered during
the analysis.}

\item{stop.time}{Detection data posterior to the timestamp set in
\code{stop.time} (in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format) is not considered during
the analysis.}

\item{save.detections}{Logical: Should the processed detections be saved for
future runs?}

\item{section.order}{A vector containing the order by which sections should
be aligned in the results.}

\item{exclude.tags}{A vector of tags that should be excluded from the
detection data before any analyses are performed. Intended to be used if
stray tags from a different code space but with the same signal as a target
tag are detected in the study area.}

\item{disregard.parallels}{Logical:  Should the presence of parallel arrays
invalidate potential efficiency peers? See the vignettes for more details.}

\item{discard.orphans}{Logical: Should actel automatically discard
detections that do not fall within receiver deployment periods, or that
were recorded before the respective animals were released?}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{bio}: A data frame corresponding to 'biometrics.csv'
\item \code{sections}: A vector of the study area sections (or NULL in the
case of the \code{explore} function)
\item \code{deployments}: A list corresponding to 'deployments.csv'
\item \code{spatial}: A list corresponding to 'spatial.csv'
\item \code{dot}: A data frame containing the connections between arrays
\item \code{arrays}: A list containing detailed information on the arrays
\item \code{dotmat}: A matrix of the distance (in number of arrays) between
pairs of arrays
\item \code{dist.mat}: A matrix of the distances (in metres) between
stations (if a 'distances.csv' is present)
\item \code{detections.list}: A list containing the detection data
for each tag
\item \code{paths}: A list of the all array paths between each pair
of arrays.
