\title{Load shapefile and convert to a raster object.}
\usage{
shapeToRaster(
  shape,
  size,
  spatial = "spatial.csv",
  coord.x = NULL,
  coord.y = NULL,
  buffer = NULL,
  type = c("land", "water")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shape}{The path to a shapefile containing land polygons of the study
area.}

\item{size}{The pixel size, in the same unit as the coordinate system.
I.e., usually either metres or degrees.}

\item{spatial}{Either a character string specifying the path to a spatial.csv
file or a spatial data frame. This argument is not mandatory, but can be
used to perform an early check of the shape file's compatibility with the
study stations and release sites.}

\item{coord.x, coord.y}{The names of the columns containing the x and y
positions of the stations in the spatial.csv file. these coordinates
MUST BE in the same coordinate system as the shape file.}

\item{buffer}{Artificially expand the map edges. Can be a single value
(applied to all edges) or four values (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax). The unit
of the buffer depends on the shape file's coordinate system.}

\item{type}{The type of shapefile being loaded. One of "land", if the
shapefile's polygons represent landmasses, or "water", if the shapefile's
polygons represent water bodies.}
}
\value{
A raster object.
}
\description{
shapeToRaster can also perform early quality checks on the shape file,
to ensure it is compatible with the remaining study data. To activate these,
set the names of the columns in the spatial.csv file that contain the x
and y coordinates of the stations using coord.x and coord.y. By default,
shapeToRaster looks for a spatial.csv file in the current working directory,
but this can be personalized using the spatial argument.

It is highly recommended to read the manual page regarding distances matrices
before running this function.
