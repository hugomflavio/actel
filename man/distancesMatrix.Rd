\usage{
distancesMatrix(
  t.layer,
  starters = NULL,
  targets = NULL,
  coord.x = "x",
  coord.y = "y",
  id.col = NULL,
  actel = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t.layer}{A TransitionLayer object, generated by
\code{\link{transitionLayer}}.}

\item{starters}{A data frame with the points from which to start measuring
the distance or the output of \code{loadSpatial()}.}

\item{targets}{A data frame with the points to which a way must be found.}

\item{coord.x, coord.y}{The names of the columns containing the x and y
coordinates in the starters and targets. Must be identical in the starters
and targets.}

\item{id.col}{The name of the column containing the IDs of the points to
be used as starters and targets. Must be identical in both files.
Ignored if actel = TRUE (default), as the stations' standard names are used.}

\item{actel}{Logical: Should the distance matrix be optimized for actel?
Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A matrix with the distances between each pair of points.
}
\description{
Using a previously created transition layer (see
\code{\link{transitionLayer}}), calculates the distances between spatial
points. Adapted from Grant Adams's script "distance to closest mpa".
If the argument 'actel' is set to TRUE (default), an actel-compatible matrix
is generated, and the user will be asked if they would like to save the
matrix as 'distances.csv' in the current directory.

It is highly recommended to read the manual page regarding distances matrices
before running this function. You can find it here:
